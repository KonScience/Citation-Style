Citation Style for Science Podcasts
===

Journal- &amp; DOI-based citation style for inserting hyper-linked bibliography entries into WordPress-based podcast show notes.

How to Use
===

1. [Download & unnpack this repository](https://github.com/KonScience/Citation-Style/archive/master.zip)
2. Optional: Open .csl file with text editor to change `<<title>>` & `<<title-short>>`
3. Import .csl into your reference manager. In [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/), this works via `<Preferences | Cite | Style | +>`. Others have not been tested so far.
4. Bibliography entries have to be pasted into the "Text"-part of WordPress' editor, not the "Visual" one.


Known Issues
===

- Zotero reports "is not a valid CSL 1.0.1 style file" upon import. Probably due to the extensive reduction of code. Books, book chapters etc. are ignored.
